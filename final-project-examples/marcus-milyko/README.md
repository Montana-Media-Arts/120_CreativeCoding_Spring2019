Here it is -- the final project!

Here's a link to video footage of the [finished game] (https://youtu.be/8wjPvJtJSHM), apoligies for the low resolution.

And a [detailed write-up] (https://akasharose.github.io/finalProject/finalPaperWriteUp.pdf) regarding the creation of the whole thing, as well as the future.

This was a fantastic assignment, and I enjoyed it thouroughly. I look forward to hopefully ending up in another class with you again!
