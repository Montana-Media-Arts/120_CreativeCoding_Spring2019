# Final Project


This project is the final project of Creative Coding 1, Spring 2017 semester. This project was enjoyable, yet challenging to make. It is designed to be interactive and relaxing to view. Here is a link to a video demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6jb85mdcDs&feature=youtu.be

This is a p5.js file that renders a live sketch of fireflies floating on a dark, edited photo background. These fireflies float independently until the mouse is pressed, which starts music playing. When the music plays, the fireflies respond to the amplitude by changing in size and vertical position. The music can be stopped by pressing the mouse again at any time, at which point the fireflies will resume floating as they did before.
