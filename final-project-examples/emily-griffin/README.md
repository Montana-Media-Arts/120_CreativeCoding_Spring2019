<h1>Final Project - Sound in Motion</h1>
<p> My final projeect, "Sound in Motion", is a music visualizer that uses the frequency levels of several mp3 files to 
create a set of arcs that move in time with music.  Each arc in each circle is assigned a different set of frequencies:
bass, low mid, mid, high mid, or treble.  This project offers the user the chance to choose from six songs and experience 
the differences in the way each piece of music "looks".</p>
<p>For me, this project was both a huge challenge and somehow much easier than any project we've done up until this point. Figuring things out, planning the sketch, and putting everything together was difficult, but once I found something I had a real interest in, things started clicking. Everything seemed to make a lot more sense once I started working with sound, which made this entire final project a really fun, enjoyable piece of work, as well as something I am very proud of, considering where I started off in this class. It was a great learning experience and challenged me to stretch my mind both logically and creatively.</p>
